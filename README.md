# File-Systems

I create a straightforward single-threaded log-structured filesystem using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace). 
FUSE lets regular users build their own file systems without needing special permissions, opening up new possibilities for designing and using file systems. 
My filesystem handle basic tasks like reading, writing, mounting, making directories, deleting files, and more.
